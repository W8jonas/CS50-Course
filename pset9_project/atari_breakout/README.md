Hello World and CS50! I'm Jonas Henrique, from Brazil and i'm very happy to have completed the course, thank you CS50!
This project is a simple version of Atari Brekout. 
I developed this based solely on the pong game presented in first track of Games in this course.
In some parts I reused pieces of the pong code.

To play this game simple open it with "Love". The game start paused, press space to initialize. 
You can move you paddle with 'A' and 'D' keys and you can pause the game when you want pressing space. 
The game finish when you destroy all the bricks.

I've developed the physics of the game on moments of collisions with the paddle and the bricks to keep the game more realistic.

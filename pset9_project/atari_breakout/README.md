Hello World and CS50! I'm Jonas Henrique, from Brazil and i'm very happy to have completed the course, thank you CS50!
This project is a simple version of Atari Brekout. 
I developed this base solely on the pong game presented in first track of Games in this course.
In some parts I reused pieces of the pong code.
